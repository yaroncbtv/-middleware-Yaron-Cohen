Everything looks to be working very nicely, however the file takes no user input and has no POST endpoint for the user
The function is invoked once you start the node file instead of when the user is actually sending a post request

The next step would be to change your text for the content and json for the log into actual user input.
It's lacking the middleware for calculating of the request duration

In addition: 
- Line 6: already declaring var fs = require('fs') globally so no need for line 22

Aside from that, looks like all the base principles are well put and organized.
